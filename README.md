2.3 Spirtual Reflection

What information should not be logged? Give two examples and explain why.

Personal information from humans should not be logged unless encrypted and controlled. Anonymized data is okay without security controls.

How does reproducibility support accountability and fairness when models affect people?
Yes and No. It supports the original user and their run data. No - the second user may not have permissions on their databricks to run the necessary commands as I've shown. The commands in canvas stuff has this issues.
