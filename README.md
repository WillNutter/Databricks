Ethics in AI — Reflection

Certain information should not be logged, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, device identifiers, or customer tokens, because logging it can violate privacy and increase the risk of data misuse. Sensitive behavioral or health-related data should also be excluded from logs, as exposing it can cause harm if accessed by unauthorized parties or taken out of context. Reproducibility supports accountability by making it possible to trace how a model was trained and which data versions were used, enabling audits and investigations when outcomes are questioned. It also promotes fairness by allowing others to consistently evaluate whether model behavior changes across datasets, time, or demographic groups, rather than relying on opaque or irreproducible results.
